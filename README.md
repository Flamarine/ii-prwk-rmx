# Illogical Impulse (Prismwork Remix)

Personal additions to [end-4's Hyprland dotfiles](https://github.com/end-4/dots-hyprland) that don't fit the original project well (or at least I think so, that said I might still contribute some features to upstream if wanted).

Changes are presented as auto-generated diffs.

## Setup

To install, run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Flamarine/ii-prwk-rmx.git
cd ii-prwk-rmx
./install.sh
```

## Contribution

To obtain the working directory, run `./apply_patches.sh`.

By the time you finish your modification you may want to run `./generate_patches.sh` to generate the diffs in `patches` before you commit your changes.

## Licensing
