# Illogical Impulse (Prismwork Remix)

Personal additions to end-4's Hyprland dotfiles that don't fit the original project well (or at least I think so, that said I might still contribute some features to upstream if wanted).

Changes are presented as auto-generated diffs.

## Setup

Run `./install.sh`. This will setup the patched dotfiles and run the installation script attached.

## Contribution

To obtain the working directory, run `./apply_patches.sh`.

By the time you finish your modification you may want to run `./generate_patches.sh` to generate the diffs in `patches`.
